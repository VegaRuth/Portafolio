He studied Photography, Web Design, Programming, Art Direction and Creative Advertising among other things; he is a compulsive self-learner which is why most of his knowledge and experience are the result of the constant need to learn and experiment with designs and new trends.

He started out as a Web designer over 15 years ago in a small room and has since worked for some of the major Telecommunications companies, Media and Advertising Agencies.

He expert in digital projects,
above all in Interactive Design and Design Interface. Without a doubt, one of his greatest strengths is the ability to develop a web project from scratch from the UI/UX concept and graphic design through to HTML development. In addition, his knowledge of marketing and advertising help him give each project a unique visual appearance for each product.

RecognitionSome of his work has won awards at major Web Design portals - earning two "Site of the day" awards in AWWWARDS, CSSWINNER, FD/É and he has been nominated for the Independent/Freelance of the Year Award 2015

He is passionate about music and the coldest places on earth hates getting up early and being a slave to the clock, so he now works independently and has founded "Veintidós Grados", an independent agency formed by independent designers.
